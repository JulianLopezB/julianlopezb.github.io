                    I'm Julian, a dedicated developer with a profound passion for building cutting-edge products fueled by Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My expertise spans across various Machine Learning domains, including NLP, Computer Vision, Web Intelligence, and Reinforcement Learning. Currently, I'm proudly serving as a senior Data Scientist at  <a href='https://olipay.com.br/br/'>Olipay</a>, a fintech startup revolutionizing financial services in Brazil through AI and alternative data.

                    One of my current ventures, <a href='https://dokuso.app'>Dokuso</a>, is a promising startup that harnesses the power of OpenAI's CLIP embeddings to enable intelligent image search across top fashion brands. This project brilliantly blends my love for AI and business.

                    In the past, I've also delved into the fascinating world of <a href='https://twitter.com/GuardianBotAi'>GuardianBot</a>, an AI-driven bot designed to detect fake users on Twitter who attempt to impersonate brands. The goal was to ensure a safer online environment, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of developing it.

                    <!-- My proficiency in utilizing tools such as Python, Git, Pytorch, Scikit, ReactJS, and GCP empowers me to create and implement robust machine learning models. I possess expertise in diverse areas, including NLP, computer vision, deployment, RESTful API, web scraping, and front-end development, among others. -->
                    My work involves various tools like Python, Git, Pytorch, Scikit, ReactJS, and GCP to build strong machine learning models. I've also explored diverse areas, including NLP, computer vision, deployment, RESTful API, web scraping, and front-end development, fostering continuous learning and growth.

                    If you're seeking someone with a genuine passion for technology and a relentless desire to drive progress, I would be thrilled to connect with you.

            <!-- <p>  Hi, I'm Julian!

                I'm a developer who loves building products based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

                I enjoy working in a wide array of Machine Learning areas and problems including NLP, Computer Vision, Web Intelligence and Reinforcement Learning. 
                 
                I'm currently working as a senior Data Science at <a href='https://olipay.com.br/br/'>Olipay</a>, a fintech startup that uses AI and alternative data to unlock access to financial services in Brazil.
                
                Currently, I'm working on a side project called <a href='https://dokuso.app'>Dokuso</a>, which leverages OpenAI's CLIP embeddings for intelligent image search across top fashion brands. This project combines my passion for AI and business and showcases my ability to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.

                Before that I've worked on a  <a href='https://twitter.com/GuardianBotAi'>GuardianBot</a>, a bot that uses AI to detect fake users in Twitter trying to impersonate on behalf of brands.

                My research interests are in understanding the dynamics in society using artificial agents that interact in a game-theoretic setting..
